# About Us

Transport for the North (TfN) are England's first Sub-national Transport Body (STB). We were formed to transform the transport system across the North of England, providing the infrastructure needed to drive economic growth.
TfN's role is to add strategic value by ensuring that funding and strategy decisions about transport in the North are informed by local knowledge and requirements, more details on our work can be found on our website at [transportforthenorth.com](https://www.transportforthenorth.com/).

# Open Source Analytics

TfN has a focus on openness and transparency and as such many of our analytics tools and processes are shared openly on GitHub for scrutiny and use by others.
The repositories fall into one of two categories, either internal TfN or common analytical framework.

## TfN

These are processes and tools which are primarily used within TfN for our various data analytics tasks, they're shared to allow for others to benefit from our work and view our analytics.
The tools and process that fall into this category are generally more specific to the transport analytics needs of the North of England and providing an evidence base to aid in decisions in and around North England.

| Repository | Description |
| :--------: | :---------- |
| [NorMITs-Demand](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand) | TfN's mainland GB transport demand model. |

## Common Analytical Framework (CAF)

The Common Analytical Framework (often shortened to CAF) is a collaboration between transport bodies in the UK to develop and maintain commonly used transport analytics and appraisal tools.
The tools and processes that fall into this category generally are branded as "caf.X" and are built in collaboration with other transport bodies and are aimed to be more generic and flexible processes which others can pickup and use in their analytics.
[CAF Handbook](https://transport-for-the-north.github.io/CAF-Handbook) is a guide which provides more details on CAF and the various tools and process.

| Repository | Description |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| [CAF.toolkit](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/caf.toolkit) | CAF.Toolkit focusses on generic tools and functions that are used across the CAF. |
